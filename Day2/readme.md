# Day 2 – HTML Practice (Forms, SEO, Media)

📖 **Summary**  
On Day 2, I continued learning HTML and practiced creating forms, understanding SEO basics, exploring Core Web Vitals, inline vs block elements, and embedding media tags.  

📂 **Files Included**  
- `index.html` → Main webpage (forms, inputs, inline/block, media)  
- `style.css` → Stylesheet (only basic colors and linking)  
- `script.js` → JavaScript file (linked with a simple alert for testing)  

🔍 **Key Concepts Practiced**  
- SEO basics & Core Web Vitals  
- Forms: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `method`, `action`  
- Inline vs Block elements  
- ID & Classes  
- Embedding Video, Audio, and Media  

💡 **How to View**  
- Open `index.html` in any browser.  
- Try filling and submitting the form (dummy `action`).  
- Check inline vs block element behavior.  
- Test video/audio embedding.  

🗒️ **Notes**  
- Practiced forms, attributes, and SEO basics thoroughly.  
- Also experimented with inline vs block elements and media tags.  
- Small styling and JS linking were added just for practice.
