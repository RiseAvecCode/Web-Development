# 🚀 Day#1 – HTML, CSS, JS Practice

## 📖 Summary
This folder contains my Day 1 progress in web development. I practiced the basics of HTML structure, added styling with CSS, and linked a JavaScript file for future interactivity.

## 📂 Files Included
- `index.html` – Main webpage with headings, paragraphs, links, image, and a table
- `style.css` – External stylesheet (currently empty or minimal)
- `script.js` – External JS file (placeholder for future scripts)
- `ironman.png` – Image used in the webpage

## 🔍 Key Concepts Practiced
- HTML tags: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<table>`
- Linking external resources (`style.css`, `script.js`)
- Using `target="_blank"` for opening links in new tabs
- Adding images with `alt` text and custom dimensions
- Creating a basic table with headers and rows

## 💡 How to View
Open `index.html` in any browser to see the webpage in action.

## 🗒️ Notes
This is my first hands-on practice combining HTML, CSS, and JS. The content includes dummy text and placeholder links to reinforce structure and formatting.
