# 🚀 Day 1 – HTML, CSS, JS Practice

## 📖 Summary
On Day 1, I practiced the **basics of web development** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I learned how to structure a webpage, add links, images, tables, and different types of lists.

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `index.html` → Main webpage (headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, lists, definitions)
- `style.css` → External stylesheet (currently minimal/empty)
- `script.js` → External JavaScript file (placeholder for future scripts)
- `ironman.png` → Image used on the webpage

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Practiced
- HTML Structure: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, headings, paragraphs
- Links (`<a>`) with `target="_blank"`
- Images (`<img>`) with alt text and dimensions
- Tables with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `colspan`, and `rowspan`
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`
- Linking external CSS & JS files

---

## 💡 How to View
1. Open `index.html` in any browser.  
2. Explore the structure and practice outputs.

## 🗒️ Notes
- This was my **first hands-on practice** combining HTML, CSS, and JS.  
- The content includes **dummy text** and placeholder links to reinforce structure and formatting.  
- Tomorrow I’ll expand with **more styling and interactivity**.
